What makes this project significant and security-critical?

Suricata is a free and open source, mature, fast, and robust network threat detection engine capable of real time intrusion detection (IDS).

As such, it should not increase the attack surface, by exposing a large variety of protocol parsers to attackers through the untrusted input of nework traffic.

Rust has been already adopted for new developments, and now old code base is being moved from C to Rust.

This contribution is a translation of the SSH parser from C to Rust.
